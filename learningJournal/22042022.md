## Day 13: React Native State Management
## What I Learnt Today
1.  **Validation of input and update the state accordingly.**
  * **Importance of handling error bounds**
    * Before we need to handle an error, we need to understand what is an error in software development life cycle. Let me summarize few common term use by programmer pertaining to error to have a better understanding based on an article I had read. ➡️ [Types of errors](https://www.javatpoint.com/bug-vs-defect-vs-error-vs-fault-vs-failure)
      *  Bug - Informal name of a defects which lead to a program breakdown due to coding errors.
      *  Defect - Discrepancy between the actual and intended results.
      *  Error - Mistake in programming code as a result unable to run or compile.
  * **So how are we going to handle all these errors?**
    * As a programmer, as long as "something" is going to obstruct my program from running, I am going to eliminate them all!!! 🦾 The question is how? Yup, I guess you already know the answer. In software development, there's a term call 'Validation', yes and its the error nemesis! But WAIT! Don't get too happy too soon, as 'Validation' is just another piece of code written by programmer to handle the errors, so there's bound to have ERRORS again!. Lol 😆, that's part of programmer's life I guess, catch errors, handle errors, catch again, handle again. "Making A Program Run Smoothly Is Responsibility, Making A Program Free Of Errors Is Duty". Yup, that's me! 😄 I'm a programmer, a full stack developer who keep learning new knowledge and concept every day. 👉Thanks to my Mentor Anya, Janan, my fellow teammate, everyone, who had made me what I am today! Thank you!👈 Ooops.. Out of topic track 😬 
  * **Let's practice validation and update the state by yesterday use case: Color Square.**
    * Based on yesterday Color Changing Square logic, the app is doing what it suppose to be, when increase or decrease button is clicked, rgb color changes depending on which color button is clicked. But there's a defect in the program, what if user keep on clicking the increase button? As the max rgb color index is 255 per color and per increment we set to is plus 15, the index will go beyond 255 if user keep clicking the increase button! The index will eventually become 400, or even go to 1000. Now, what happen when user wanted to change back the color? Yes, user need to click decrease button so many times in order to see the color change. That's not we want and its not user-friendly at all. We need to change the logic to validate this defect.

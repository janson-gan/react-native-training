  I got 3 errors after transferring the counter screen code to typescript.
  <ul>
    <li>state: <b>(parameter) state: any 'state' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133) Parameter 'state' implicitly has an 'any' type. ts(7006)</b></li>
    <li>action: <b>(parameter) action: any 'action' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133) Parameter 'action' implicitly has an 'any' type. ts(7006)</b></li>
    <li>useReducer parameter: <b>No overload matches this call</b></li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h4>3.  Solving The Errors</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>state: refer to the count declare in useReducer parameter, so need to declare the type as number and pass in to state.</li>
  <pre>
  interface Count {
      count: number;
    }
  </pre>
    <li>action: refer to the process of the function. So need to declare the necessities type. In this case, we have two buttons for the increment and decrement, declare as string and the amount that are going to increase or decrease declare as number and pass in to action.</li>
  
  <pre>
    interface Action {
      type: "increase" | "decrease";
      amount: number
    }
  </pre>
  </ul>
  
<figure>
  <figcaption>Fg.2 No more errors for the state and action.</figcaption>

<ul>
  <li>Inside the reducer, we use switch statement to toggle between increase and decrease action, and this reducer function need to return something in order to get rid of the error.</li>
  <pre>
    const reducer = (state: Count, action: Action) => {
    //call the type property inside action
      switch (action.type) {
            //if is increase result count state plus 1 append with previous count state 
            case "increase":
                return {...state, count: state.count + action.amount};
             //if is decrease result count state minus 1 append with previous count state 
            case "decrease":
                return {...state, count: state.count - action.amount};
             default:
             return state;
      }
    }
  </pre>
</ul>

<h4>4. Applying reducer to the buttons</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Pass in 'dispatch' function from useReducer to the onIncrease and onDecrease button function.</li>
  <li>'dispatch' function need to pass in two arguments: value and action</li>
</ul>

```
     return (
            <View>
                <CounterButton
                    onIncrease={() => dispatch({ type: "increase", amount: 1 })}
                    onDecrease={() => dispatch({ type: "decrease", amount: 1 })}
                />
                <View style={styles.container}>
                     <Text style={styles.counterText}>{state.count}</Text>
                </View> 
            </View>
        );
```
<ul>
  <li>The arguments value and action are taken from interface Action we declare earlier. The type is either "increase" or "decrease" and the amount is a number which I set it to 1. Every button click will be either increase by 1 or decrease by 1. The incrementation and decrementation are define by the reducer function switch statement which we declare earlier too.</li>  
</ul>

<h4>5. Refactor Switch Statement</h4>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  useReducer actually is much more easier to use than useState. Reducer created an action to update the state, then pass to dispatch to send out the process. In this way is much more clearer to understand what is happening on that piece of code. Both useState and useReducer have their plus point on certain use cases, so choose the way that we are most comfortable with and also simpler to understand between the developer and the team.

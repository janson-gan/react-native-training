## Day 13: React Native State Management
## What I Learnt Today
1.  **Validation of input and update the state accordingly.**
  * **Importance of handling error bounds**
    * Before we need to handle an error, we need to understand what is an error in software development life cycle. Let me summarize few common term use by programmer pertaining to error to have a better understanding based on an article I had read. ‚û°Ô∏è [Types of errors](https://www.javatpoint.com/bug-vs-defect-vs-error-vs-fault-vs-failure)
      *  Bug - Informal name of a defects which lead to a program breakdown due to coding errors.
      *  Defect - Discrepancy between the actual and intended results.
      *  Error - Mistake in programming code as a result unable to run or compile.
  * **So how are we going to handle all these errors?**
    * As a programmer, as long as "something" is going to obstruct my program from running, I am going to eliminate them all!!! ü¶æ The question is how? Yup, I guess you already know the answer. In software development, there's a term call 'Validation', yes and its the error nemesis! But WAIT! Don't get too happy too soon, as 'Validation' is just another piece of code written by programmer to handle the errors, so there's bound to have ERRORS again!. Lol üòÜ, that's part of programmer's life I guess, catch errors, handle errors, catch again, handle again. "Making A Program Run Smoothly Is Responsibility, Making A Program Free Of Errors Is Duty". Yup, that's me! üòÑ I'm a programmer, a full stack developer who keep learning new knowledge and concept every day. üëâThanks to my Mentor Anya, Janan, my fellow teammate, everyone, who had made me what I am today! Thank you!üëà Ooops.. Out of topic track üò¨ 
  * **Let's practice validation and update the state by using yesterday Udemy use case: Color Square.**
    * Based on yesterday Color Changing Square logic, the app is doing what it suppose to be, when increase or decrease button is clicked, rgb color changes depending on which color button is clicked. But there's a defect in the program, what if user keep on clicking the increase button? As the max rgb color index is 255 per color and per increment we set to is plus 15, the index will go beyond 255 if user keep clicking the increase button! The index will eventually become 400, or even go to 1000. Now, what happen when user wanted to change back the color? Yes, user need to click decrease button so many times in order to see the color change. That's not we want and its not user-friendly at all. We need to change the logic to validate this defect.

   <table>
    <tr>
     <th>Code without validation, rgb index go beyond 255 or below negative number</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td><img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-04-20%20at%202.33.57%20PM.png" width="480" />
     <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Apr-22-2022%2012-08-02.gif" width="220" />
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>

* **Control flow**
  * Using control flow to validate the defect.
    * First, need a method to check what happen when rgb color index go beyond 255, and the best candidate goes to 'if-else' statement! üëè
    * By using 'if-else' statement, we can perform a task when rgb color index go beyond 255.
    
     ```javascript
     if (red + COLOR_INCREMENT > 255) {
      return;
     }
     ```
     * In the above statement, we tell the 'validator', if the rgb color index hit 255 then do nothing (return nothing) further and stop there even if user keep clicking the increase button. 
     * And yes, its works! Rgb color red index stop at 255 despite increase button keep clicking, and decreasing the color index now is much more easier and is immediate effect. This method can apply to all buttons including decrease button, just have to replace the '+' to '-' operator. üëç
 
 <table>
   <tr>
    <th>Code with validation</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-04-22%20at%2012.47.41%20PM.png" width="480" />

    </td>
   </tr>
  </table>
 
 * Codes looks good. ü§î But then if insert the 'if-else' statement into all the six buttons, the code will look messy and difficult to understand. How about separating the 'if-else' statement and wrap it into a function? Sounds good, let's try!
 ```javascript
 const setColors = (color, change) => {
     if (red + change > 255 || red + change < 0) {
       return;
  } else {
   setRed(red + change);
   }
 }
 //Button
   <ColorButton 
      style={styles.redBtn} 
      title="Red" 
      onIncrease={() => {setColors(red, COLOR_INCREMENT)}}
      onDecrease={() => {setColors(red, -1 * COLOR_INCREMENT)}}
     />
 ```
 * This concept seems good but there's one defect inside there. If apply to only one color button there won't be any issue, but if nested with other color inside the if-else statement then there will be big problem. As if-else statement verify boolean condition, meaning true or false, if nest all the button inside, all the rgb color index will be updated when any of the button is click because the condition is always true for all buttons! As long as the condition is true, the setter method will keep updating the color index.
 > There is a 'OR ||' operator in the if-else comparison condition.
 > While any one of the condition is true, if-else statement will perform the task.
 > So in this case when a buton is click, if-else will check from top to bottom starting from red till blue, and the condition is always true for all
 > colors because all color is either greater than 255 or lesser than 0.

  * I think a better choice to use is [Switch Statement](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp) instead of if-else. Switch is to perform different task based on different condition and it matches our use case. We need to perform different task (set the different colors) based on different button clicked. Let's try it out on the red button first.
  ```javascript
   const setColors = (colors, change) => {
    switch (colors) {
      case 'red':
        red + change > 255 || red + change < 0 ? null : setRed(red + change);
        return;
    }
  ```
  
  * We have wrapped the switch statement inside the setColors function with parameter of 'colors' & 'change'. Also include 'colors' parameter for the switch statemet. I'll break down the statemet for easy understanding:
    * case 'red': - if colors is red.
    * red + change > 255 || red + change < 0 ? - if red + change is greater than 255 OR red + change is lesser than 0 (ternary operator)
    * null : setRed(red + change) - task: do nothing otherwise set red color += the increment index.
  * The piece of code in english text means if the color is red, then check for the increment is more than 255 and check is less than 0. If more than 255 or less than do nothing (null), other than that set the red color index from the button click increment.

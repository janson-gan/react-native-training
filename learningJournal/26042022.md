  I got 3 errors after transferring the counter screen code to typescript.
  <ul>
    <li>state: <b>(parameter) state: any 'state' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133) Parameter 'state' implicitly has an 'any' type. ts(7006)</b></li>
    <li>action: <b>(parameter) action: any 'action' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133) Parameter 'action' implicitly has an 'any' type. ts(7006)</b></li>
    <li>useReducer parameter: <b>No overload matches this call</b></li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h4>3.  Solving The Errors</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>state: refer to the count declare in useReducer parameter, so need to declare the type as number and pass in to state.</li>
  <pre>
  interface Count {
      count: number;
    }
  </pre>
    <li>action: refer to the process of the function. So need to declare the necessities type. In this case, we have two buttons for the increment and decrement, declare as string and the amount that are going to increase or decrease declare as number and pass in to action.</li>
  
  <pre>
    interface Action {
      type: "increase" | "decrease";
      amount: number
    }
  </pre>
  </ul>

<ul>
  <li>Inside the reducer, we use switch statement to toggle between increase and decrease action, and this reducer function need to return something in order to get rid of the error.</li>
  <pre>
    const reducer = (state: Count, action: Action) => {
    //call the type property inside action
      switch (action.type) {
            //if is increase result count state plus 1 append with previous count state 
            case "increase":
                return {...state, count: state.count + action.amount};
             //if is decrease result count state minus 1 append with previous count state 
            case "decrease":
                return {...state, count: state.count - action.amount};
             default:
             return state;
      }
    }
  </pre>
</ul>

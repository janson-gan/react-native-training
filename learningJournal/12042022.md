## Day 7: React Native Flatlist component
## What I Had Learnt Today
* - [x] **The FlatList Component**
  * Convert array of elements into List.
  * 'data' props is required to turns array into list. 
  * 'renderItem' is another props required to cycle thru the array and print out the array properties to the screen.
  * Beside just rendering the array properties to the screen, react need a 'Key' to differentiate elements from each other otherwise there will be a 'Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop'. Key prop is act as a id which can be use to add, remove or update the element.
  * 'Key' can be inserted by adding "Key: '1'" to the property. Key has to be unique and it must be a string. Another way to include the key to the list can use 'keyExtractor' prop to loop thru the array and set the key to the element. "keyExtractor={(parameter) => parameter.**key**} (Replace the 'key' with any unique string in the array).
  * **horizontal**: By adding 'horizontal' prop to FlatList, we can scroll the screen from left to right.
  * **showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}**: to hide the bottom scroll bar when scrolling from left to right.
* - [x] **Exercise**
  * To display array of elements to the list screen.

#### Method Tried
- Google search <code>PhaseScriptExecution</code> return lots of solution.
- Trial and error the most suitable one but no avail.
- Heed advice from Willy by using Terminal to run the project for checking any missed error.

- Indeed, there's another error on the top, thanks to Willy. Google search the <code>xcodebuild command exited with error code 65</code>, found some solutions from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55235825/error-failed-to-build-ios-project-we-ran-xcodebuild-command-but-it-exited-wit), trial and error but no avail too.
- Uninstall and re-install xcode also doesn't solve the issue.
- Read thru, trial and error the solution from the link provided from Jan (Thanks to Jan's help) also can't solve the issue.
- Going thru the error message line by line and saw one statement:

# Learning Journal 25th - 26th May 2022
## Day 29-33: Tracker App (Continue from 24th May 2022)
### What I Learnt Today
#### Making API Request (Unsuccessful)
- Making a request for sign up.
- Dispatch an action to update state and send a error message to user.
- Display the error message in signup component.

- Sign up successfully with token.
- If sign up with the same email, suppose to throw an error, but I was unable to console log the error.
- Instead of getting the response error, I get some html error message asking me to sign up.

```javascript
const signup = (dispatch) => {
  return async ({ email, password }) => {
    try {
      const response = await TrackerApi.post('/signup', { email, password });
      console.log(response.data);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err.message);
    }
  };
};
```
- But using Thunder to post the same email able to return the response error message.

#### Async Storage / Storing The Token
- Set initial state value to <code>token: null</code>.
- By default no token means user not logged in, if null become jsonwebtoken means user had logged in.
- Using AsyncStorage to store user token <code>AsyncStorage.setItem('token', response.data.token);</code>.
#### Navigate From Outside Of React
- Navigating without the navigation prop.
- NavigationActions use by Udemy tutorial is from v4, for v6 use <code>[createNavigationContainerRef](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigating-without-navigation-prop/)</code>

## Day 10: React Native State Management
## What I Learnt Today
* - [x] **What Is React State Management?**
   * The 'State' is a container or a memory that store data which are persistent across component rendering.
   * The 'State' simply means JavaScript Data Structure.
   * The UI may appear differently based on the interaction between user and the application.
   * In order to change or update something in the application we need to use State.
* - [x] **Challenge: Apply Counter component to react-starter project.** 
   * Create a new counter folder under screens folder.
   * Under counter folder, create index.tsx for the counter screen and styles.ts for the styling.
   * As the counter represent a number, I declare the useState as type number with a default value 0:
   ```
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState<number>(0);
   ```
   * If the default value set to string, there would be a type error:
   ```
   Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number | (() => number)'.
   ``` 
   * To make the code looks neat, I seperated the 'onPress' function and declare it on the top.
   * Index.tsx (Counter screen).

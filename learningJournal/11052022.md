<h2>Day 25: React Native Restaurant App - Single result</h2>
<h3>What I Learnt Today</h3>
<h4>1. Communicating Between Screens</h4>
<ul>
  <li>To get the list of images from a single restaurant, we need to pass in the restaurant id from resultList.tsx and route it resultShowScreen.tsx</li>
  <li>From the resultList.tsx insert <code>{ id: item.id }</code>to the navigation.navigate parameter.</li>
  <li>After inserting the code, as expected, type error...</li>

  <li>Error type:</li>

  <li>I suppose typescript is complaining that the object '{id: string}' did not assign to the resultsProps parameter, and it is missing of other properties that I had declared in resultsProps too.</li>
  <li>Looking at the navigate method:</li>

  <li>Navigate takes in two parameters, first one name of the screen which is correct, second is 'resultsProps'. I suspect typescript is refering to this 'resultsProps' which object '{id: string }' is not in there. 'resultsProps' is being declared in RootStackParamsList at App.tsx</li>
  <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%2010.31.16%20AM.png" width="500" />
  <li>Replace the 'resultsProps' with object '{id: string}' should solve this typescript error, I guess.</li>
  <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%2010.49.27%20AM.png" width="450" />
  <li>Yes, indeed. Typescript is happy now... üòÜ</li>

</ul>
<h4>2. Fetching A Single Restaurant</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use <code>route.params</code> in resultShowScreen.tsx to retrieve data from resultList.tsx.</li>
  <li>But before that we need to pass route props to resultShowScreen component<code>type Props = NativeStackScreenProps&ltRootStackParamsList&gt</code>.</li>
  <li>Destructuring 'id' to route.params. ('id' from resultList.tsx)<code>  const { id } = route.params;</code></li>
  <li>As usual, typescript not happy again...</li>
  <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%202.19.03%20PM.png" width="450" />
  <li>Error type:</li>
   <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%202.22.16%20PM.png" width="550" />
  <li>I guess is the same error type as before, 'id' cannot be found in 'Readonly&ltunknown&gt | undefined'. Now, where is this 'Readonly&ltunknown&gt | undefined'?</li>
  <li>Let's check the route.params.</li>
  <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%202.22.49%20PM.png" width="550" />
  <li>So 'Readonly&ltunknown&gt | undefined' is params of the route. How should I set the 'id' to this params? Let's check the route.</li>
   <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%202.41.42%20PM.png" width="550" />
  <li>The route said its prop can contain another parameter which is a string type... ü§î. Maybe I should try putting in the route name there.</li>
    <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%202.50.14%20PM.png" width="550" />
    <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%202.51.03%20PM.png" width="550" />
  <li>Yup.. error gone. Object 'id' accepted as string and route.params no more undefined.üëç</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Showing a List of Images</h4>
<ul>
  <li>To show list of single restaurant food images, we need to get the id of that restaurant and retrieve the images from the object id.</li>
  <li>Store the images in result variable which we need a useState.</li>
  <li>Import yelp api to get the id.</li>
  <li>Use useEffect to handle the side effect, render the search only once.</li>
  <li>Use FlatList to render out the images.</li>
  <li>Initial result state set to null is because we are fetching an object, if no result state would be null.</li>
  <li>Notice the 'result' is complaining something...</li>
  <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%204.34.45%20PM.png" width="550" />
  <li>As we set the initial result state as null, so typescript telling us that the result might be nothing. But our intention is only null if there is no result.</li>
  <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%204.47.48%20PM.png" width="500" />
  <li>In this case we can add in an optional type beside result to indicate our intention.</li>
  <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%204.49.40%20PM.png" width="500" />
  <li>Yes, error gone for the result but another errors arise... ü§Ø. Property 'name' and 'photo' does not exist on type 'never'</li>
  <li>'Never' refer to result state. Whenever a state is 'null', 'undefined' or empty (useState()), typescript refer them as never.</li>
  <li>Since we are fetching object, I'll declare name and photos in the useState as object or null.</li>
  <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%205.22.31%20PM.png" width="500" />
  <li>Typescript now able to recognise the name and photos type after I declared the type in the useState, but now the error transmitted to FlatList data. üò†</li>
  <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%205.28.47%20PM.png" width="550" />
  <li>Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'readonly any[] | null | undefined'. I suppose this means that type string declared in useState cannot set to FlatList data type which is '(property) data: readonly any[] | null | undefined'.</li>
  <li><a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#required-data">FlatList data</a> need an array type to fit in but not string.</li>
  <li>We can't simply set the useState to array as we are fetching an object. Since FlatList data is a readonly[], maybe I can set the name and photos type to readonly array.</li>
   <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%205.28.47%20PM.png" width="550" />
   <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-05-11%20at%208.48.28%20PM.png" width="450" />
  <li>And yes! This solve the FlatList data type error and all errors are resolved. Typescript is happy again, so am I üòÑ.</li>
</ul>

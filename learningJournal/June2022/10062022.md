#### Method Tried
- Google search <code>PhaseScriptExecution</code> return lots of solution.
- Trial and error the most suitable one but no avail.
- Heed advice from Willy by using Terminal to run the project for checking any missed error.

- Indeed, there's another error on the top, thanks to Willy. Google search the <code>xcodebuild command exited with error code 65</code>, found some solutions from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55235825/error-failed-to-build-ios-project-we-ran-xcodebuild-command-but-it-exited-wit), trial and error but no avail too.
- Uninstall and re-install xcode also doesn't solve the issue.
- Read thru, trial and error the solution from the link provided from Jan (Thanks to Jan's help) also can't solve the issue.
- Going thru the error message line by line and saw one statement:

- Try googling <code>nvm is not compatible with the "npm_config_prefix"</code> and found [resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34718528/nvm-is-not-compatible-with-the-npm-config-prefix-option), and [resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27651892/homebrew-installs-nvm-but-nvm-cant-be-found-afterwards).
- Follow what had been discussed:
  - Use brew to install nvm (which I uninstall and use brew to re-install again).
  - After done installing, create a <code>~/.zshrc</code> config file (My terminal using zsh) and insert two lines:
  ```
  export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
  source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
  ```
  - Ctrl + x to exit 
  - Close terminal.
  - Restart Mac and rebuild the project.
  - And this solution solve my IOS issue.
- Now my Mac able to run on IOS, Android and Web.
### 2. Rendering Track List Issue
- After refreshing the track list screen, it render a infinite list, refresh again it render back to normal list screen.
- Will look into the state update according to Anya's advice.

## Day 2: React Native basics and Typescript Basics Part 1
### Objectives:
* Learn the basics of react native.
* Be able to run the react native starter project on the simulator.
* Learn the basic topics of typescript. 
## What I Had Learnt Today
### Basics Of React Native 
* - [x] **What is React Native?**
  * React Native is a JavaScript framework for creating mobile apps for IOS and Android system.
  * The mobile user interface is built using JavaScript libray.
  * React Native using native rendering API in Objective-C for IOS and Java for Android, therefore the application is rendering in real mobile UI components.
  * React Native able to access the phone camera or user's location by providing JavaScript interfaces to platform API.
* - [x] **Advantages Of React Native.**
  * Some iOS and Android features are currently unsupported, and the community is still figuring out the best practices.
  * React Native consider new framework, documentation might be updating frequently.
---
### Runing React Native Starter Project On Simulator
* - [x] Install node.
* - [x] npm install to starter folder.
### Challenges
There were couple of errors arises during the installation of npm. I can't recall what were the errors then (This is the lesson I have learnt. Always screenshot the errors if there is any, regardless whether can solve it or not. If can solve, we can refer back the error and tie it with the solution found, so that in future someone might encounter the same issue and we can refer to the solution), but I managed to solve the issue by searching some solutions from googling. 
#### Method Use to resolve:
* Restart Macbook.
* Re-install node, cocoapods, xcode.

### Basic Topic Of TypeScript
* - [x] **React Native Project File System**
  * Going through the file system folder, especially the src folder, to understand the relationship between each component and the method (import) use to interlink with each other.
* - [x] **TypeScript Basic Part 1**
  * Commonly used primitives (Can only store single value) data type: string, number and boolean.
  * String representing value that are inside double quotes or single quote, example: "Hello World".
  * Number is referring to digit regardless of decimal or whole number, example: 56.
  * Boolean has only two value: true or false.
* - [x] **Understanding TypeScript Annotation Function**
  * Hands on writting the function code to get familiar with the concept based on resource from [www.typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html).
* - [x] **Structure Of Variable Annotation**
  * const text: string = "Hello world";
  * const digit: number = 123;
  * const isDone: boolean = true;
  * const fruitsArray: string[] = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];
  * const numArray: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 5];
  * const anything: any = [1, "string", true];

# Summary
Although had completed Day 2 task on TypeScript topic, I feel that I had not fully comprehend the concept yet. In order to build up the solid foundation of TypeScript (Not only TypeScript but apply to all learning), I have to continue to research and keep on practicing.

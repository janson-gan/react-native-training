## Day 8: React Native Navigation
### What I Had learnt Today
* **Button**
  * Provides only a limited amount of customisation.
  * Import the button element from react-native in order to use the button element.
  * Button element is a self closing tag.
  * To render the button to the screen, we need to add 'title' prop and the value must be a string else there would be errors.
  * We can add 'color' prop to change the color of the text.
  * Does not accept 'style' prop, so we are unable to customise to the app's design.
  * To make the button works, we can add 'onPress()' event handler to it.
* **TouchableOpacity**
  * It has a touch effect on any element that is wrapped within it. This might be a text or an image.
  * To use the touchableOpacity, import touchableOpacity element from react-native.
  * We need to include an opening and closing tag, unlike the Button element. Use 'Text' element within touchableOpacity tag to display the text.
  * We can use image as well within the wrapper.
  * Able to use 'style' prop to customize the button as well. 
* **Navigation**
  * To navigate between screen, npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack.
  * import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
  * import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
* **Challenge: Create a button from home screen and navigate to a new screen.**

## What I Had Learnt Today
### Basics Of React Native

### Runing React Native Starter Project On Simulator
* - [x] Install node.
* - [x] npm install to starter folder.
### Challenges
There were couple of errors arises during the installation of npm. I can't recall what were the errors then (This is the important lesson I have learnt. Always screenshot the errors if there is any, regardless whether can solve it or not. If can solve, we can refer back the error and tie it with the solution found, so that in future someone might encounter the same issue and we can refer to the solution), but I managed to solve the issue by searching some solutions from googling. 
#### Method Use to resolve:
* Restart Macbook.
* Re-install node, cocoapods, xcode, npm.
### Basic Topic Of TypeScript
* - [x] **React Native Project File System**
  * Going through the file system folder, especially the src folder, to understand the relationship between each component and the method (import) use to interlink with each other.
* - [x] **TypeScript Basic Part 1**
  * Commonly used primitives (Can only store single value) data type: string, number and boolean.
  * String representing value that are inside double quotes or single quote, example: "Hello World".
  * Number is referring to digit regareless of decimal or whole number, example: 56.
  * Boolean has only two value: true or false.

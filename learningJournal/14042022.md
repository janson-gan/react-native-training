## Day 9: React Native Custom Component
## What I Had Learnt Today
*   **Reuseable Component: Create A Image Resuable Component**
    * Create a new image screen component name imageScreen.js for the reuseable component to display or can use any other screen as well.
    * Create and export resueable component name imageDetail.js.
    * In the imageScreen.js (Parent) import the imageDetail.js (Child) file by writing: import ImageDetail from "some directories".
    * In the imageScreen.js, return the view of the imageDetail component and add the image details.
    * The require in the imageSoure provide the image path we want to show.
    * 'imageSource' and 'title' are the props that need to pass over to imageDetail.js.
    ```
    const ImageScreen = ({ navigation, route }) => {
      return (
       <ImageDetail imageSource={require("../../image_path.jpg")} title="Image title"/>
       <ImageDetail imageSource={require("../../image_path.jpg")} title="Image title"/>
    }; <ImageDetail imageSource={require("../../image_path.jpg")} title="Image title"/>
    ```
    * In the imageDetail pass in the 'props' to the parameter to fetch the properties from ImageScreen.js.
    * To able to use image element, we need to import image from react-native.
    ```
      const ImageDetail = (props) => {
         return (
            <Image source={props.imageSource} />
            <Text>{props.title}</Text>
         )
      };
    ```

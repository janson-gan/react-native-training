  <li>The advantage of creating own custom hooks is that we can reuse them on other components if it needs a same logic as well.</li>
  <li>Custom hook function's name always start with 'use'. This is to allow react to do the linking and error checking rules to ensure the codes are working. </li>
  <li>Easy to maintain as custom hook stay in one location, rather than scatter around the components.</li>
</ul>

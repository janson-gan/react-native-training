### Runing React Native Starter Project On Simulator

### Challenges
There were couple of errors arises during the installation of npm. I can't recall what were the errors then (This is the lesson I have learnt. Always screenshot the errors if there is any, regardless whether can solve it or not. If can solve, we can refer back the error and tie it with the solution found, so that in future someone might encounter the same issue and we can refer to the solution), but I managed to solve the issue by searching some solutions from googling. 
#### Method Use to resolve:
* Restart Macbook.
* Re-install node, cocoapods, xcode.

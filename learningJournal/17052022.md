<h2>Day 25: Blog App: React Native Context with useState</h2>
<h3>What I Learnt Today</h3>
<h4>1. What is <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-context-for-beginners/">useContext in React</a>?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>React Context allows us to pass data to any components without using props.</li>
  <li>It allows us to share data across our components more easily.</li>
  <li>The advantage of using React Context is that it can save us the trouble of having to pass props to multiple levels of nested components.</li>
  <li>React Context is a built-in API in React, which means we can construct and utilize it directly in any React project by importing React.</li>
  <li>There are 'Context' and 'Provider' within the useContext.</li>
  <li>'Context' is to pass data to other components, and 'Provider' is to provide props to the element that wrap within it. (My own understanding)</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Creating a useContext component in typescript.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>After transfering code to typescript.</li>
  <li>BlogContext.tsx</li>

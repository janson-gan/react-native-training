## Debugging Tracker App
### What I Learnt Today
#### 1. Tracker App Rendering Issue
- Track list is not consistency rendering properly at tracker list screen.
- A refresh will cause the list to render empty list endlessly, another refresh it will return back to normal.
- Not only refresh will cause the issue, navigating screen back and forth would result the same problem.

#### 2. Method Tried To Resolve
- Head advice from Anya and Janan to look into the state updating and fetchTracks function.
- Using try and catch method to handle the error.
- Check thru the tracker server and and Ngrok response.
- Found out whenever the endless render occur, Ngrok would response a <code>304 not modified</code>.

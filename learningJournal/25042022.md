<h2>Day 14: React Native State Management (Manage State With Reducer)</h2>
<h3>What I learnt Today</h3>
<h4>1. What is reducer?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A pure function that accept current state and an action as argument and return a new state result.</li>
  <li>Every result return from reducer is a state object.</li>
  <li>Take in two parameters, a function to perform on the state to get a new state result, and a initial state.</li>
</ul>
<h4>1. How to change the reducer state?</h4>
<p>Based on the Color Square use case</p>
<ul>
  <li>Declare reducer:</li>
  <pre>
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0});
  </pre>
  <li>The state is the object of the color red, green and blue with 0 value.</li>
  <li>Dispatch is a function to be call from the button click.</li>
  <li>The reducer is a function to set the increment or decrement of the rgb color index.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Create reducer function:</li>
  <pre>
    const reducer = (state, action) => {
      switch(action.colorToChange) {
        case "red":
            return {...state, red: state.red + action.colorToChange};
      }
    }
  </pre>
  <li>The state is the object of the color red, green and blue with 0 value.</li>
  <li>Dispatch is a function to be call from the button click.</li>
  <li>The reducer is a function to set the increment or decrement of the rgb color index.</li>
</ul>

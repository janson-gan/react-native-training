<h2>Day 24: React Native Restaurant App - Navigation to Single Result</h2>
<h3>What I Learnt Today</h3>
<h4>1. Showing A Single Result</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In order not to cramp all the render list into one place, create a additional component to house the render result and pass to resultList.tsx</li>
  <li>resultDetail.tsx</li>

  </p>
</ul>
<h4>2. Showing Additional Info</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Retrieving images, rating and reviews from yelp data.</li>
  <li>Import image component from react native</li>
  <li>uri: Is a string representing the resource identifier for the image, which could be an http address, a local file path, or the name of a static image resource</li>
  <li>There's a console warning stated 'source.uri should not be an empty string' after input the image source. I'm not too sure why there's an empty string warning though I already pass in the image source from the renderItem result (result.image_url).</li>

  </p>
  <li>Found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48927997/trouble-solving-source-uri-should-not-be-an-empty-string-in-react-native">solution</a> from stackoverflow to solve this warning issue</li>
  <li>Insert a ternary operator statement: <code>source={{uri: result.image_url !== "" ? result.image_url : undefined}}</code></li>
  <li>To my understanding, the statement saying if result.image_url is not an empty string, then show the image_url from the result, otherwise is undefined. result.image_url is retrieving image data from an api, so it is not an empty string.</li>

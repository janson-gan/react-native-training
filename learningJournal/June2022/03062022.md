## React Native Testing Library
### What I Learnt Today
#### 1. How To Query?
- Based on the [Guiding Principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles/), as closely as possible, our test should simulate how users interact with our code.
  #### Recommendation Queries Priority
    #### Query Accessible To Everyone:
    - getByText
    - getByDisplayValue
    - getByPlaceholderText
    - getByLabelText
    - getByHintText
    - getByAccessibilityState
    - getByAccessibilityValue
   #### Queries Users Can Infer
   -  getByRole
   #### Test ID
   -  getByTestId
#### 2. Testing Of AuthForm
- Check form is render properly
- Check submit button is working
- Check form is empty after submit

## Debugging Tracker App
### What I Learnt Today
#### 1. Tracker App Rendering Issue
- Track list is not consistency rendering properly at tracker list screen.
- A refresh will cause the list to render empty list endlessly, another refresh it will return back to normal.
- Not only refresh will cause the issue, navigating screen back and forth would result the same problem.

#### 2. Method Tried To Resolve
- Head advice from Anya and Janan to look into the state updating and fetchTracks function.
- Using try and catch method to handle the error.
- Check thru the tracker server and and Ngrok response.
- Found out whenever the endless render occur, Ngrok would response a <code>304 not modified</code>.
- If render normally, Ngrok wound response a <code>200 OK</code>.

- Google <code>304 not modified</code> status code and found some information.
- [304 not modified](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33072519/what-does-304-not-modified-means-in-console-status-means) - An HTTP 304 not modified status code means that the website you're requesting hasn't been updated since the last time you accessed it.
- [Solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55390970/how-to-clear-api-cache-in-react-native-app-programmatically): How to clear cache.
- Base on the above method solve my rendering issue:
```javascript
const fetchTracks = dispatch => async () => {
      const response = await trackerApi.get('/tracks', {
          headers: {
              'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate',
              'Pragma': 'no-cache',
              'Expires': 0
          }
      });
      dispatch({ type: 'fetch_tracks', payload: response.data });
  };
```

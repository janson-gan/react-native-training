<h2>Day 25: React Native Restaurant App - Single result</h2>
<h3>What I Learnt Today</h3>
<h4>1. Communicating Between Screens</h4>
<ul>
  <li>To get the list of images from a single restaurant, we need to pass in the restaurant id from resultList.tsx and route it resultShowScreen.tsx</li>
  <li>From the resultList.tsx insert <code>{ id: item.id }</code>to the navigation.navigate parameter.</li>
  <li>After inserting the code, as expected, type error...</li>

  <li>Error type:</li>

  <li>I suppose typescript is complaining that the object '{id: string}' did not assign to the resultsProps parameter, and it is missing of other properties that I had declared in resultsProps too.</li>
  <li>Looking at the navigate method:</li>

  <li>Navigate takes in two parameters, first one name of the screen which is correct, second is 'resultsProps'. I suspect typescript is refering to this 'resultsProps' which object '{id: string }' is not in there. 'resultsProps' is being declared in RootStackParamsList at App.tsx</li>

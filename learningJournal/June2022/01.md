## Unit Testing
### What I Learnt Today
#### 1. What is Unit Test?
- Unit testing is a software testing method to test on individual method, function, class, procedure, module, element, or object.
- Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
- Unit testing makes debugging easier. It will be faster to develop app, and cost less to fix errors in the code.
#### 2. Framework to use for testing.
- Facebook developed the Jest unit testing framework. Jest was inspired by the JavaScript testing framework, Jasmine.
- Jest is built into React, which makes Jest a simple,for React Native unit testing. As a bonus, Jest not only can unit test Reactive Native apps, but it can also unit test other JavaScript frameworks, such as Angular, Vue, Bable, TypeScript, and Node.
- Starting from react-native version 0.38, a Jest setup is included by default when running react-native init. The following configuration should be automatically added to package.json file:
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "jest": {
    "preset": "react-native"
  }
}
```
#### 3. What to test in React Native Application
- Api: For sending http requests to backend server and response process.
- Components: Reusable Components in the app.
- Contexts: Custom Hook for global states.
- Hooks: Custom hooks for components.
- Navigation: Components for app navigation.
- Reducers: Functions used for the hooks/contexts.
- Screens: Components for app to display while user navigate within the app.
- Utils: Functions for the project to use such as date/string/math manipulations.
  #### Type of React Unit Tests
  - Functions.
  - Components.
  - Custom Hooks.
#### 4. First Demo Function Test.
- Create a file name <code>sum.ts</code> with a function that adds two numbers.
```javascript
export const sum = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
```
- Create another file name <code>sum.test.ts</code> to contain the test.
```javascript
//import the file that need to be test
import { sum } from './sum';
//first parameter state the purpose of the test in string,
//second parameter is the description of the test function
test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    //function is expecting 2 parameter 1 and 2, result would be 3
    expect(sum(1,2)).toBe(3 );
});
```
- Run the test by typing <code>npm test</code> in the terminal.
- Result shown in the terminal:

- Test fail demo:

- Jest would be telling where the test fail: <code>expected: 3 recieved: 4</code>.
- The test expected after the sum should be 3, but return result is 4.
- The error lies here:
```javascript
  2 |
      3 | test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    > 4 |     expect(sum(1,3)).toBe(3 );
        |                      ^ //Jest pinpoint the error here
      5 | });
```
#### Snapshot Test
- A snapshot is a configuration file defining the component style, UI, and props.
- To test UI doesn't change unexpectedly.
- A Snapshot test render a UI component, take a snapshot and compare it to a reference snapshot file store in the test.
- Test will fail if the two snapshot files doesn't match. 
#### Example of Snapshot Test
- Create a new component name <code>Intro.tsx</code>.
- Create a new test file inside <code>\__tests\__</code> folder.

- The test file extension should be .tsx.
- Inside the test file write the test code:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
//React render package to render React component to pure javascript object
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import Intro from '../src/unitTest/intro';

test('renders correctly', () => {
  //to render the component and convert to JSON format
  const tree = renderer.create(<Intro />).toJSON();
  //to compare with the previous snapshot file
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```
- Run <code>npm test</code>

## Unit Testing
### What I Learnt Today
#### 1. What is Unit Test?
- Unit testing is a software testing method to test on individual method, function, class, procedure, module, element, or object.
- Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
- Unit testing makes debugging easier. It will be faster to develop app, and cost less to fix errors in the code.
#### 2. Framework to use for testing.
- Facebook developed the Jest unit testing framework. Jest was inspired by the JavaScript testing framework, Jasmine.
- Jest is built into React, which makes Jest a simple,for React Native unit testing. As a bonus, Jest not only can unit test Reactive Native apps, but it can also unit test other JavaScript frameworks, such as Angular, Vue, Bable, TypeScript, and Node.
- Starting from react-native version 0.38, a Jest setup is included by default when running react-native init. The following configuration should be automatically added to package.json file:
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "jest": {
    "preset": "react-native"
  }
}
```

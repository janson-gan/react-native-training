## Day 12: React Native State Management
## Content: Updating state of the parent component from the child component 
## What I Learnt Today
* - [x] **Create a square which able to change its color by button click**
1.  Create a SquareScreen.js boilerplate under screen folder. (Parent)
2.  Create a ColorButton.js bolierplate under components folder. (Child)
3.  Inside SquareScreen.js import ColorButton.js and return the view of the buttons and add a title prop.
```javascript  
return (
  <View>
    <ColorButton title="Red" />
    <ColorButton title="Green"/>
    <ColorButton title="Blue"/>
  </View>
)
```
4.  Create two reusable button in ColorButton.js for increasing and decreasing purposes.
    * **To retrieve the title name for the button, use destructuring method inside the parameter with curly braces.**
    * I include a '+' and '-' sign to the color name to indicate increase and decrease.
```javascript
    const ColorButton = ({ title }) => {
      return (
        <View>
          <TouchableOpacity>
            <Text>{title} +</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>

           <TouchableOpacity>
            <Text>{title} -</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        </View>
      )
     }
```
5.  In SquareScreen.js create a square view to display the color and also create 3 color states for red, green and blue.
    * Create a function on every button to increase and decrease the number of rgb index so as to change the color of the square. 
    * In each button, there is a setter method to increase and decrease the rgb index.
```javascript
const SquareScreen = () => {

//Set all initial color state to 0 which is black color 
  const [red, setRed] = useState(0);
  const [green, setGreen] = useState(0);
  const [blue, setBlue] = useState(0);

  return (
  //Button to increase and decrease the rgb index
  <View>
    <ColorButton 
      title="Red" 
      onIncrease={() => {setRed(red + 15)}}
      onDecrease={() => {setRed(red - 15)}}
      />
      
    <ColorButton 
      title="Green"
      onIncrease={() => {setGreen(green + 15)}}
      onDecrease={() => {setGreen(green - 15)}}
      />
      
    <ColorButton
      title="Blue"
      onIncrease={() => {setBlue(blue + 15)}}
      onDecrease={() => {setBlue(blue - 15)}}
      />
      
     {/* Color square, pass in the color state variable to rgb to replace the index dynamically */}
     {/* The rgb index number will either increase or decrease based on the button click  */}
    <View>
      <View style={{ height: 150, width: 150, backgroundColor: `rgb($(red), $(green), $(blue))` }} />
    </View>
    
  </View>
  
}
```
* - [x] **How to pass the state of parent to the child component?**
  * We can pass the state as props to the child from parent component.
  * In the function parameter of the ColorButton.js, we can insert 'props' as a parameter.
  ```javascript
  const ColorButton = (props) => {

  }
  ```
  * Once props is being declare, we can make use of the props to call the state of its parent, SquareScreen.js, by using dot notation.
  ```javascript
  const ColorButton = (props) => {
    return (
      <View>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => props.onIncrease()}>
          <Text>{props.title} +</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity> 
      </View>
    );
  };
  ```
* - [x] **Another way to pass the state of parent to the child component.**
  * We can pass the state by using JavaScript Object Destructuring method.
  * Insert curly braces into the parameter of ColorButton.js and declare the property within the curly braces as of parent component.
  * Using the destructuring method we can omit the 'props' keyword and use the parent property name directly.
  ```javascript
     const ColorButton = ({ title, onIncrease }) => {
    return (
      <View>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => onIncrease()}>
          <Text>{title} +</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity> 
      </View>
    );
  };
  ```

* - [x] **Challenge: Transfer Udemy exercise to React Native TypeScript project.**
  * **Challenge 1: Add color lable under the color square**
  * Under color square <View> tag, add a<text> tag to hold and display the color rgb label
  ```javascript
  <Text>Red:{red}, Green: {green}, Blue: {blue}</Text>
  ```

    </figure>
  </div>
  
  * In this challenge, I learnt how to declare the type for function and style. :bulb: 
  * Initial stage I declare style type as 'React.CSSProperties', its work fine for the button styling, but there's a type error. I hover over to the error and see any suggestion fix and I realised that I can declare the type as 'StyleProp`<`ViewStyle`>`', and now the errors are gone.

  </div>
  
* **Challenge 2: Convert color state into color object**
  * First, I declare interface for the color type.
  ```javascript
    interface Colors {
      red:number;
      green: number;
      blue: number;
    }
  ```
  * I set useState to the color interface and initial the object state to 0.
  ```javascript
  const [colors, setColors] = useState<Colors>=({red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0});
  ```
  * As I already declare the colors as object, I need to update the state as object as well under the color count button onIncrease and onDecrease function.
  * Within the setColors function, include the spread syntax (...colors) to fetch the previous color and append to a new color when button is clicked.
  * Green and blue button apply the same rule as well.
  ```javascript
  <ColorButton 
    style={styles.redBtn}
    title="Red" 
    onIncrease={() => setColors({ ...colors, red: colors.red + COLOR_INCREMENT })}
    onDecrease={() => setColors({ ...colors, red: colors.red - COLOR_INCREMENT })}
    />
  ```
  * For the displaying of color square and label, use dot notation to fetch out the color.
  ```javascript
  <View style={styles.colorSquare}>
     <View style={{ height: 150, width: 150, backgroundColor: `rgb(${colors.red}, ${colors.green}, ${colors.blue})`}}/>
     <Text style={ styles.colorText }>Red:{ colors.red }, Green: { colors.green }, Blue: { colors.blue }</Text>
  </View>
  ```
* - [x] **Challenge 3: Replace the initial state as 'null'.**
  * After replace the initial state as 'null', first error was the type error:
    <div>
      <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-04-21%20at%202.44.07%20PM.png" width="800" />  
    </div>
    
  *  To solve this type issue, I use union type for the useState:
    ```
      const [colors, setColors] = useState<Colors | null>(null);
    ```
  * But by declaring null in useState, I had created another type issue for my button function.
     <div>
      <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-04-21%20at%203.36.47%20PM.png" width="800" />  
    </div>
  
  * I had wasted half a day searching google for solution to overcome this issue (Maybe due to my search key word üòÜ), finally got an ideal from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67164160/react-hook-to-set-a-state-value-if-null) use case. Using if-else to check the state condition. So this is my solution:
    <div>
       <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-04-21%20at%203.53.25%20PM.png" width="800" /> 
    </div>
  * Finally got the wavy red line away... üòì
  * This solution might not be the best approach, but is my half a day effort talking to my computer... üòÜ
  * So happy, I thought I had win the 'null' war... But not yet... üòµ‚Äçüí´
  * What is this??? Object is possibly null??? üëà luckily this time round had a direct hint for me to search google.
     <div>
       <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-04-21%20at%204.06.57%20PM.png" width="800" /> 
    </div>
  * Bingo! One search and found the [solution](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/typescript-object-is-possibly-undefined).
  * "To solve the error, use optional chaining to short-circuit if the reference is equal to null, e.g. p1?.address?.country." exert from the link article. Thank you! üôè
  * I include a '?' mark to indicate the option type to the color object.
    
     <div>
       <img src="https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-04-21%20at%204.21.39%20PM.png" width="800" /> 
    </div>

* - [x] **The Color Square Works Again!** üòú
    * As the initial state set to null, the inital start screen will be blank without the color square.
    * Once start to click, the color square will be black color because in my button click function statement i set all color to 0 if state is null.
     <div>

### Summary
The 3rd challenge was a great one üëç. It helps to train my brain muscel (Sacrifice my brain cell too üòÜ) in a way to build 
my thinking process. During the process, I had learnt how to use vscode to hint to assist me in solving the problems and understand
the data type. I had learnt using control flow to determine the state of the app. I had learnt to use the optional parameter type (?).
 
### Mistake I Make
During the implementation of control flow, I created [two if-else statement](https://github.com/janson-gan/react-native-training/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-04-21%20at%203.53.25%20PM.png) to check for the state is null to perform incrementation and decrementation of rgb color. I was so happy that I solve the 'null' problem and forgotton that two function is only meant for the red button! What about the green and the blue? Including red button means I need to create Six functions to handle the increment and decrement.üò¨ Fortunately, there's one way to minimise these hassels. Maybe I can use ternary operator inside the button itself rather than seperate them and occupy so much space. Let's do it.

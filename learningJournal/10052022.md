<h2>Day 24: React Native Restaurant App - Navigation to Single Result</h2>
<h3>What I Learnt Today</h3>
<h4>1. Showing A Single Result</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In order not to cramp all the render list into one place, create a additional component to house the render result and pass to resultList.tsx</li>
  <li>resultDetail.tsx</li>

  </p>
</ul>
<h4>2. Showing Additional Info</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Retrieving images, rating and reviews from yelp data.</li>
  <li>Import image component from react native</li>
  <li>uri: Is a string representing the resource identifier for the image, which could be an http address, a local file path, or the name of a static image resource</li>
  <li>There's a console warning stated 'source.uri should not be an empty string' after input the image source. I'm not too sure why there's an empty string warning though I already pass in the image source from the renderItem result (result.image_url).</li>

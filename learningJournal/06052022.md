<h2>Day 21: React Native Restaurant App - With UseEffect</h2>
<h3>What I Learnt Today</h3>
<h4>1. useEffect</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A react native hook function that allows us to run the code one time when component is first render to the screen.</li>
  <li>Has a few different arugements can pass in.</li>
  <li>First argument: Always a function for us to pass in some code to run when component is rendered for the first time.</li>
  <li>Second argument: configure number of times the function runs. Pass in an empty array to configure the function to run once.</li>
</ul>

<pre>
  useEffect(() => {
  //initial search for pasta when first rendering.
    apiSearch("pasta");
  //insert number value to determind the number of times the function needs to run.
  }, []);
</pre>

<h4>2. Challenge: Transfer code to typescript</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Declare interface props in the useResults.tsx (reusable hook) and assign the props to the results state, as the id, name and price are the property of the api call result data.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Inside resultsList.tsx, import the interface props from useResults.tsx and assign it to results props to identify id and name type during the renderItem callback function. We can add in more property in future through the results props if we are getting more data from api call.</li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Beside learning of useEffect hook and reusable hook component today, I had learnt to declare a prop as an array that pass from parent component. Common type of props pass from parent component was either string or number, but today there was a property in result list name 'results' that contain a api call function to fetch data and pass in to results state which contain other several properties of type. In this case, I can't just asign the results props as string[] in result list, as the renderItem callback function need some data type to identify other property that are pass from parent component result state. To assign correctly without errors, I had to import a 'resultProps' from results state and assign it to results which contain id and name property.

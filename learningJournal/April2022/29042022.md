<h2>Day 18: React Native Design System: Developing UI</h2>
<h3>What I Learnt Today</h3>
<h4>Objectives: Making App Intro Screen with Login Screen</h4>
<h4>1. Installing the package</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Introductory screen package in react native, 'react-native-onboarding-swiper' and 'react-native-app-intro-slider'.Both packages are able to create the same effect like swiping, skip button and next button. But which package should I use? After doing some research on the net, I've found out some pros and cons on these two packages based on the statistic from <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/react-native-app-intro-slider-vs-react-native-onboarding-swiper">npm trends.</a></li>  
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>After trying both packages, I prefer 'App-intro-slider' as it can gain more control over the UI, for example, I can customise the default button, I can choose to show or hide 'Next' and 'Skip' or 'Done' buttons.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. App intro screen necessary packages</h4>
<ul>
  <li>react-native-app-intro-slider - navigation of intro screen</li>
  <li>Store the text, images to object and render the list in App-Intro-Slider</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Formik - Login form</li>
  <li>Using if-else to validate user input</li>
  <li>Import Alert component to show the notification to user</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Having a hard time seaching and amending the type errors when switching the code to typescript, especially when trying to navigate from screen to screen. Need to explicitly define the props type. Having a <em>'undefined is not an object (evaluating navigation.navigate)'</em>  error when trying to navigate to another screen. Still searching for this solution. May share this error during tomorrow sharing session with the team.

<h2>Day 20: React Native Restaurant App - With API</h2>
<h3>What I learnt Today</h3>
<h4>1. Using axios library for making request</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Very light package in size.</li>
  <li>Easy to understand for making a request.</li>
  <li>To install: npm install axios</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Creating a api request</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new ts file name yelp. <a href="https://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> is a web application for searching of international businesses. Using their api to integrate into our food react native app.</li>
  <li>In yelp.ts</li>
</ul>

<pre>
  <code>
    import axios from 'axios';

    export default axios.create({
    baseURL: "https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses",
    headers: { Authorization: "Bearer apikey" }
    }); 
  </code>
</pre>

<h4>3. Setting up the request</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In the searchScreen.tsx, create a function to make a get request.</li>
  <li>Created two useState, one for the api result and one for error message.</li>
</ul>

<pre>
  <code>
    //using asyn because making api request is an asynchronous operation
    const apiSearch = asyn () => {
      //search parameter is to append to the baseUrl in yelp.ts file to perform a search
      //with asyn function, need to add in await to wait to the response to get back.
      //Once data is being fetch, it will assign to the response variable
      const response = await yelp.get("/search", {
      //use try and catch method for error handling to notify user if there's any.
      try {
        params: {
          limit: 50,
          searchValue: searchValue,
          location: "singapore"
        }
      });
         //to get the result of businesses and assign to result state
        setResult(response.data.businesses)
    } catch (err) {
        setErrorMesg("Something went wrong.")
      }
    };
  </code>
</pre>

<h4>4. Completed code</h4>

</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
  Today topic learn how to use axios in react native to make a get request in search bar. By declaring asyn and await, can omit out the usual way of fetching data like '.then(responses => response.json())', much more simpler way then the fetch method. Recap on the error handling using try and catch method to notify user just in case if there are any issue with the get request..

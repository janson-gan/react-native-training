## Day 13: React Native State Management
## What I Learnt Today
1.  **Validation of input and update the state accordingly.**
  * **Importance of handling error bounds**
    * Before we need to handle an error, we need to understand what is an error in software development life cycle. Let me summarize few common term use by programmer pertaining to error to have a better understanding based on an article I had read. ➡️ [Types of errors](https://www.javatpoint.com/bug-vs-defect-vs-error-vs-fault-vs-failure)
      *  Bug - Informal name of a defects which lead to a program breakdown due to coding errors.
      *  Defect - Discrepancy between the actual and intended results.
      *  Error - Mistake in programming code as a result unable to run or compile.
  * **So how are we going to handle all these errors?**
    * As a programmer, as long as "something" is going to obstruct my program from running, I am going to eliminate them all!!! 🦾 The question is how? Yup, I guess you already know the answer. In software development, there's a term call 'Validation', yes and its the error nemesis! But WAIT! Don't get too happy too soon, as 'Validation' is just another piece of code written by programmer to handle the errors, so there's bound to have ERRORS again!. Lol 😆, that's part of programmer's life I guess, catch errors, handle errors, catch again, handle again. "Making A Program Run Smoothly Is Responsibility, Making A Program Free Of Errors Is Duty". Yup, that's me! 😄 I'm a programmer, a full stack developer who keep learning new knowledge and concept every day. 👉Thanks to my Mentor Anya, Janan, my fellow teammate, everyone, who had made me what I am today! Thank you!👈 Ooops.. Out of topic track 😬 
  * **Let's practice validation and update the state by yesterday use case: Color Square.**

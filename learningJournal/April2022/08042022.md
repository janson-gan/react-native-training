## Day 5: Typescript Basics: Modules
## What I Had Learnt Today
* - [x] **What is Modules?**
   * When creating large scale application, it is much easier to split the code into different files. Example, one file might manages the authentication, the other file might manages databases interaction. By splitting up the files, the application would be more structured and much more easier to read and update as well. In this scenario, we can use TypeScript module system in importing and exporting different files.
   * Why import .js but not .ts is because after typescript compile .ts, it will produce another file with the same file name but with extension .js.
<pre>
//FileABC.ts
const greeting = () => {
  console.log("How are you?");
}
<b>export default FileABC</b>;
</pre>

<pre>
//FileDEF.ts
<b> import FileABC from "FileABC.js";</b>
greeting();
</pre>

  *  We can export individual variable, function and class by omitting out the default keyword.
<pre>
//FirstFile.ts
<b>export</b> const greeting = "Hello";
<b>export</b> const name = "Janson";
</pre>

<pre>
//AnotherFile.ts
import {greeting, name} from "./FirstFile.js";

console.log(greeting) // result -> "Hello"
console.log(name) // result -> "Janson"
</pre>

 *  We can export all objects and put into a single namespace using '* as some name'.
<pre>
  import * as sayHello from "./FirstFile.js";
</pre>

* - [x] **Recap on Day 1 to Day 5 practices** 
  * Revise TypeScript from Udemy and codecademy.

## Day 8: React Native Navigation
### What I Had learnt Today
* **Button**
  * Provides only a limited amount of customisation.
  * Import the button element from react-native in order to use the button element.
  * Button element is a self closing tag.
  * To render the button to the screen, we need to add 'title' prop and the value must be a string else there would be errors.
  * We can add 'color' prop to change the color of the text.
  * Does not accept 'style' prop, so we are unable to customise to the app's design.
  * To make the button works, we can add 'onPress()' event handler to it.
* **TouchableOpacity**
  * It has a touch effect on any element that is wrapped within it. This might be a text or an image.
  * To use the touchableOpacity, import touchableOpacity element from react-native.
  * We need to include an opening and closing tag, unlike the Button element. Use 'Text' element within touchableOpacity tag to display the text.
  * We can use image as well within the wrapper.
  * Able to use 'style' prop to customize the button as well. 
* **Navigation**
  * To navigate between screen, npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack.
  * import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
  * import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
* **Destructuring**
  * Allows us to take data from an array or object and assign it to its own variables
  <pre>
   const user = {
    name: "Max",
    color: "blue",
    age: "10"
    };
    
    <b>//Method to retrieve data before ES6</b>
    console.log(user.name);
    console.log(user.color);
    console.log(user.age);
    
    <b>//Destructuring method</b>
    const {name, color, age} = user;
    console.log(name);
    console.log(color);
    console.log(age);
  </pre>
* **Challenge: Create a button in home screen and navigate to a new screen.**

 * Create a Demo folder in dashboard with index.tsx and styles.ts
 * Under constant folder in navigation-names.ts, include: Demo = "Demo".
 * Under AppStack.tsx, import Demo and create Stack.screen component for Demo.
 * Under Home folder in index.tsx, add Button to create the link to Demo screen.

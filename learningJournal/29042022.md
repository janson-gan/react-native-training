<h2>Day 18: React Native Design System: Developing UI</h2>
<h3>What I Learnt Today</h3>
<h4>Objectives: Making App Intro Screen with Login Screen</h4>
<h4>1. Installing the package</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Introductory screen package in react native, 'react-native-onboarding-swiper' and 'react-native-app-intro-slider'.Both packages are able to create the same effect like swiping, skip button and next button. But which package should I use? After doing some research on the net, I've found out some pros and cons on these two packages based on the statistic from <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/react-native-app-intro-slider-vs-react-native-onboarding-swiper">npm trends.</a></li>  
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>After trying both packages, I prefer 'App-intro-slider' as it can gain more control over the UI, for example, I can customise the default button, I can choose to show or hide 'Next' and 'Skip' or 'Done' buttons.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. App intro screen necessary packages</h4>
<ul>
  <li>react-native-app-intro-slider - navigation of intro screen</li>
  <li>Formik - login form</li>
</ul>

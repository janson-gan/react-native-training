## Debugging Tracker App
### What I Learnt Today
#### 1. Tracker App Rendering Issue
- Track list is not consistency rendering properly at tracker list screen.
- A refresh will cause the list to render empty list endlessly, another refresh it will return back to normal.
- Not only refresh will cause the issue, navigating screen back and forth would result the same problem.

## Day 8: React Native Navigation
### What I Had learnt Today
* **Button**
  * Provides only a limited amount of customisation.
  * Import the button element in order to use the button element.
  * Button element is a self closing tag.
  * To render the button to the screen, we need to add 'title' prop and the value must be a string else there would be errors.
  * We can add 'color' prop to change the color of the text.
  * Does not accept 'style' prop, so we are unable to customise to the app's design.
* **TouchableOpacity**
  * It has a touch effect on any element that is wrapped within it. This might be a text or an image, for example.
* Navigation - need to npm install @react-navigation/stack
* Challenge: Create a button from home screen and navigate to a new screen.
